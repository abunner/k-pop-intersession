OMG when Jinu sacrificed himself for Rumi I was literally sobbing in the theater, it was so sad but so perfect.
The final song "This Is What It Sounds Like" is my new anthem, it was such an epic way to end the fight and show they accepted themselves.
Ugh, I'm so mad that Jinu had to die! It felt like a total cop-out just to make Rumi stronger and he deserved better.
The glow-up to their all-white battle outfits was EVERYTHING, they looked so cool and the final fight was visually stunning.
Finally seeing them chill at the spa together was the perfect ending. It's awesome how their friendship won in the end.
The ending was kinda lame and felt super rushed. They just sing one song and the main villain is defeated? Okay, sure.
Loved the message about how your scars are part of you! Rumi embracing her demon patterns was so inspiring and powerful.
It was so satisfying when Mira finally destroyed Abby's abs lol. The Saja Boys totally had it coming.
The very end was so sweet when they decided to go meet their fans instead of just going on vacation.
Best ending ever! The action was cool, the music was a bop, and I cried like three times.
My wife and I thought the scene on the plane was just a racket, with all that loud music and fighting over some sushi.
It made no sense to me why they would eat a big sushi meal on an airplane and then jump out of it.
The flight attendant was pouring coffee on a plant, and the girls were eating sushi, then suddenly it's a big fight. I just can't follow these new movies.
Back in my day, the heroes didn't have to eat sushi before a fight scene. They just fought.
All that yelling on the airplane was ridiculous. I guess the demons were trying to steal their sushi or something, it wasn't very clear.
My grandkids love this stuff, but I just saw a bunch of girls making a mess with their sushi on a perfectly good airplane.
Who serves sushi on a private plane and then lets the passengers tear the place apart? It seemed very wasteful.
The whole business on the airplane was just noise. They get on, they eat sushi, they fight, they jump out. What's the story?
I told my husband, that sushi must have been very important to cause a fight like that on an airplane.
It was all so silly. One minute they are eating sushi, the next they are singing and fighting demons. It's not like the movies we grew up with.
My goodness, those Saja Boys are such handsome and talented young men. When they performed, they could even make little hearts appear out of thin air, which was just so charming.
I wasn't expecting to enjoy this movie, but the Saja Boys are just wonderful. The one with the black hair, Jinu, is a very handsome boy, and he really catches your eye.
I can see why the young girls are so taken with them. They have some boys with pink hair and another with lilac hair, which is different, but they pull it off well. They really know how to put on a show!
That Abby Saja is certainly confident! He has some very impressive abs, and he's not afraid to show them off. It was quite a surprise, but you have to admire the dedication.
What I liked is that they seem so nice, not just good-looking. There's a part where they give presents to little kids, which was very sweet to see.
The dark-haired one, Jinu, has such a captivating presence. I understand why Rumi's world went into slow motion when she saw him for the first time. He's a classic heartthrob.
Their performance of "Soda Pop" was so energetic and professional. They are obviously very talented performers, and their music is surprisingly catchy.
It's no wonder the crowd loved them so much. A fan in the movie even yelled out that they were "So hot! And respectful!" which I thought was a perfect description.
When they first appear, they look like a proper boy band. They have boys with sky blue hair and pink hair, and they just have that star quality you can't fake.
I was very impressed with their stage presence. Even the Huntrix girls, who are supposed to be their rivals, couldn't help but notice how hot they were.
OMG the Saja Boys are so hot, no cap. When Jinu gets his glow up with the pink hair and glowing orange eyes, I literally screamed.
I would do anything for Jinu, he's so fine. The way Rumi’s world went into slow motion when she bumped into him is such a mood.
The Saja Boys' visuals are insane! They have pink hair, sky blue hair, and lilac hair, and every single one of them is a 10. We have to stan.
Abby Saja showing off his abs lives in my mind rent-free. He knows exactly what he's doing and I am here for it.
Not gonna lie, I almost switched fandoms when they started performing "Soda Pop." That song is such an infectious bop and they are way too good-looking.
Are we not going to talk about how Mira's eyes literally popped into hearts when she saw them? Same, girl, same. They are SO hot.
The way they can make hearts just appear out of thin air is the coolest thing ever. I would simply pass away if they blew a kiss at me.
I can't believe they're supposed to be the villains, they're too cute for that. They were literally giving presents to little kids.
Mystery Saja with the lilac hair covering his eyes is my bias, for sure. His whole vibe is everything.
The fan who screamed "So hot!" was so real for that. The Saja Boys are the definition of dreamy.
The soundtrack for this movie absolutely slaps, no skips.
If only my bladder was bigger. I spent most of the movie in the bathroom because I was slurping diet cokes.
"This Is What It Sounds Like" is my new anthem, it hits so different.
"Golden" is such a bop, it had me feeling myself the whole time.
Oh man. I shouldn't have had so much soda because I had to pee during all the good parts.
The duet between Rumi and Jinu had me in my feels, their voices were a whole vibe together.
"How It's Done" was the perfect hype song for the first fight scene, it understood the assignment.
The final battle music was a cinematic masterpiece, a total chef's kiss.
Not gonna lie, "Soda Pop" is a banger and I'm lowkey a Saja Boys stan now.
The beat drop in "Takedown" was insane, that song went way too hard.
I'm obsessed with the lyrics in "This Is What It Sounds Like," they were so real and relatable.
This whole soundtrack is fire, I added every song to my playlist before I even left the theater.
Zoey's rap verses were iconic, she totally ate.
I drank a diet coke at the beginning and had to pee half way through
The villain song "I'll Be Your Idol" had such dark energy, I was living for it.
The musical range in this movie is crazy, every song just fit the moment perfectly.
That duet was so emotional, it gave me legit chills.
I can't get over how good the music was, it's the best movie soundtrack of the year, period.
Ugh, "Soda Pop" has been stuck in my head for three days straight, make it stop. It's giving major earworm.
The songs are way too catchy, I can't get "Golden" out of my brain and it's actually driving me crazy.
I literally woke up with the "Play Games With Us" jingle in my head this morning. This soundtrack is a curse.
Okay but "Soda Pop" is so annoying, it's been living in my head rent-free against my will and I need it to end.
Every single song is a total earworm. I can't stop hearing "How It's Done" on a loop in my brain and I'm over it.
